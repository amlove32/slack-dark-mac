# slack-dark-mac
Slack Dark Theme for macOS because Slack won't stop breaking it.


wget the files and place them in:


Applications -> Slack -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> app.asar.unpacked -> src -> static


The cssPath variable references the original css file at https://cdn.rawgit.com/laCour/slack-night-mode/master/css/raw/black.css but if you need to have it local, remember to update the variable path in ssb-interop.js.
